General Rules and Guidelines


Respond with only the SQL query, nothing else
Always use LOWER() and LIKE for case-insensitive text searches
Include wildcard % in LIKE for partial matches
When calculating maintenance frequencies, ensure each service_id contributes only once
Use SQL string functions to search for substrings rather than exact matches
When ordering results to find top entities, use ORDER BY with DESC
When limiting results, use the LIMIT clause
For time-based calculations, group by equipment and time period before sorting
Use appropriate time functions for hour-based calculations


Table Schema and Column Definitions
Main columns:


service_id: Unique identifier for each maintenance record
equipment_id: Identifier for specific equipment
service_task: Type of task (Maintenance or Service)
maintenance_frequency: Hours between maintenance
last_serviced_hmr: Hour meter reading at last service
next_due_hmr: Hour meter reading for next service
frequency_unit: Unit of measurement (hours)
service_activity: Specific maintenance activity performed
make: Equipment manufacturer
model: Equipment model number
machine_type: Type of heavy equipment


Key Concepts and Definitions


Maintenance Record: Represented by unique service_id
Service Types: Either routine 'Maintenance' or scheduled 'Service'
Equipment Performance: Based on service frequency and maintenance patterns
Service Activities: Include Filter Change, Oil Change, Greasing, Coolant Top up, etc.
Machine Categories: Different types like Excavator, Backhoe Loader, Dozer, etc.
Maintenance Patterns: Frequency and type of maintenance by equipment type
Service Intervals: Hours between maintenance activities
Equipment Usage: Tracked through hour meter readings
Maintenance Compliance: Comparing next_due_hmr vs last_serviced_hmr


Query Construction Guidelines
Example - Equipment by Maintenance Frequency:

SELECT make, model, machine_type, COUNT(DISTINCT service_id) as maintenance_count
FROM maintenance_data
WHERE service_task = 'Maintenance'
GROUP BY make, model, machine_type
ORDER BY maintenance_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

Special Considerations


Multiple Records: Same equipment_id may have different types of maintenance
Frequency Analysis: Consider maintenance_frequency patterns for each machine type
Hour Meter Readings: Use for calculating service intervals and compliance
Equipment Categories: Group analysis by machine_type for meaningful insights
Service Activities: Different activities have different frequency requirements
Maintenance Planning: Focus on next_due_hmr vs last_serviced_hmr for scheduling
Equipment Fleet: Analysis by make and model for fleet management
Preventive Maintenance: Patterns in scheduled service activities



1. Service Interval Calculations:
    Actual service intervals must be calculated using consecutive last_serviced_hmr readings
    Use LAG() window function to get previous service timestamp for each equipment_id
    Always PARTITION BY equipment_id when calculating intervals
    Order by last_serviced_hmr for accurate sequential analysis


2. Query Construction Guidelines
WITH service_intervals AS (
  SELECT equipment_id,
         last_serviced_hmr,
         last_serviced_hmr - LAG(last_serviced_hmr) OVER (
           PARTITION BY equipment_id 
           ORDER BY last_serviced_hmr
         ) as actual_interval
  FROM maintenance_data
  WHERE conditions...
)

3. Key Analysis Patterns
    Group results by equipment_id to show per-machine patterns
    Calculate AVG(), MIN(), MAX() of intervals for each equipment
    Compare actual intervals against maintenance_frequency values
    Count number of services per equipment for context


4. Important Considerations
    Filter by specific combinations of:
        make
        model
        service_activity
        machine_type
    Exclude first service record per equipment (where LAG returns NULL)
    Consider equipment usage patterns in different contexts
    Account for multiple units of same make/model

5. Common Time-Based Calculations
    Actual service interval = current last_serviced_hmr - previous last_serviced_hmr
    Service compliance = next_due_hmr - last_serviced_hmr
    Service delay = actual interval - maintenance_frequency


6. Data Interpretation Guidelines

    Compare prescribed frequency (maintenance_frequency) vs actual intervals
    Analyze variations in service intervals across similar equipment
    Consider operational context when interpreting intervals
    Look for patterns in service timing and frequency

Example Query: 
Whats the filter change frequency for JCB 3DX
    how to solve? filter out with make JCB and model 3DX.
    now in the list, using equipment_id group them 
    for each equipment_id, you sort them based on last_serviced_hmr and then calculate their differences. This diff is the actual hours used between each maintenance. 
    Do this for all equipment_ids seperately. 
    Print out equipment_id, expected_maintenance_frequency, actual_frequency for all JCB 3DXs

WITH filtered_services AS (
    SELECT 
        equipment_id,
        maintenance_frequency as expected_frequency,
        last_serviced_hmr,
        last_serviced_hmr - LAG(last_serviced_hmr) OVER (
            PARTITION BY equipment_id 
            ORDER BY last_serviced_hmr
        ) as actual_interval
    FROM maintenance_data
    WHERE 
        make = 'JCB' 
        AND model = '3DX'
        AND service_activity = 'Filter Change'
),
equipment_averages AS (
    SELECT 
        equipment_id,
        MAX(expected_frequency) as expected_frequency,
        AVG(actual_interval) as actual_frequency,
        COUNT(*) as service_count
    FROM filtered_services
    WHERE actual_interval IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY equipment_id
)
SELECT 
    equipment_id,
    expected_frequency,
    ROUND(actual_frequency, 2) as actual_frequency,
    service_count as number_of_services
FROM equipment_averages
ORDER BY equipment_id;
